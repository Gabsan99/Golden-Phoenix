### A modified version of the Translucence theme for BetterDiscord

I decided to upload this theme just because I thought it would be nice to share it with others; there is only one small issue:

* I can't include the image I used for copyright reasons, so I suggest you go to [Pixground](https://www.pixground.com/phoenix-4k-wallpaper/) where I downloaded it, load it on imgur and paste a link that ends with .jpeg in url() field in the .css file.
* I also left instructions in the .css file in the form of comments about this.
* Hope there aren't any issues and you like the slightly modified theme :)
### This is how it should look like:
